# OpenMuse

*The Open Python Muse S Athena EEG Decoder*

[![Muse S Athena](media/device.webp)](https://eu.choosemuse.com/products/muse-s-athena)


This software allows recording, streaming via LSL and visualizing signals from the **Muse S Athena** headband.

> [!WARNING]  
> OpenMuse is NOT an official product of InteraXon Inc and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the company. It does not come with any warranty and should be considered an experimental software developed for research purposes only.

## Installation

Install from GitHub by opening a terminal and running:

```powershell
pip install https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/OpenMuse/zipball/main
```

## Usage

After installing the package, open a terminal and use the following commands:

### Find Muse devices

Power up the Muse S Athena headband (a blue light should appear on the front) and run:

```powershell
OpenMuse find
```

This will print the MAC addresses of nearby Muse devices. Note the address of your device for the next steps.


### Record data to a file

```powershell
OpenMuse record --address <your-muse-address> --duration 60 --outfile data.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> By default, recording and streaming use the `--preset p1041`, which enables all channels. You can change the preset using the `--preset` argument (see below for the list of documented presets).

Once your file is recorded, you can load it in Python using:

```python
import pandas as pd
import OpenMuse 

with open("data.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    messages = f.readlines()
data = OpenMuse.decode_rawdata(messages)

# Plot Movement Data
data["ACCGYRO"].plot(
    x="time",
    y=["ACC_X", "ACC_Y", "ACC_Z", "GYRO_X", "GYRO_Y", "GYRO_Z"],
    subplots=True
)
```

### Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)

> [!NOTE]  
> OpenMuse uses [MNE-LSL](https://mne.tools/mne-lsl/), an improved python-binding for the Lab Streaming Layer C++ library, `mne_lsl.lsl`, replacing `pylsl`.

To stream a file over LSL, use:

```powershell
OpenMuse stream --address <your-muse-address>
```

The following options are available:
- `--address`: The MAC address of your Muse device (required)
- `--duration`: Duration of the recording in seconds (if not specified, streaming will continue until you press Ctrl+C in the terminal)



To visualize a live LSL stream, open a new terminal (while the streaming is running) and run:

```powershell
OpenMuse view
```
